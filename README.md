# Image Caption Generator
## Setup
1. In a pyhton environment or a virtual environment-
```bash
pip install Flask Pillow requests transformers torch torchvision torchaudio
```
2. ``` python app.py ```
3. Then in another terminal cd ImageCaptionGenerator
4. ``` npm install ```
5. ``` npm run dev ```
6. The website is running on http://localhost:8000

## How it works?
1. The python server (flask) uses the pretrained Salesforce model-
2. AI Model Source: [Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-large](https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-large)
3. The node server uses multer and axios to communicate with the flask server to send the file and get the captions to be shown to the fronend
4. The client side uses another free api called AI21 Studio Paraphrase which is <b> free until February 2024 </b>
5. NOTE- you do not need that free api in client side and can work with the original caption generated by the flask server
